notes: |
  Fast Coder workflow optimized for parallel feature implementation.

  Use cases:
  - Implementing multiple independent features simultaneously
  - Rapid prototyping
  - Batch code generation

  Pattern: Star (hub-and-spoke)
  - Central coordinator broadcasts coding tasks
  - Multiple agents code in parallel
  - Results aggregated for review

  Workflow:
  1. Coordinator decomposes feature request into independent tasks
  2. Broadcasts tasks to available coding agents
  3. Agents implement features in parallel
  4. Code reviewer checks all implementations
  5. Tester validates functionality
  6. Results synthesized and presented

  Performance:
  - 3-5x faster than sequential coding
  - Best for 3-10 independent features
  - Each feature should take 5-15 minutes

  Example usage:
  "Implement these features:
   1. User authentication API
   2. Email validation
   3. Password reset flow
   4. Session management
   5. Rate limiting"
